# Well W-666 Project Proposal - Executive Summary

## Project Overview
Well W-666 represents a transformative opportunity in the North Sea. We will seamlessly integrate our AI-driven predictive maintenance system with existing offshore infrastructure. The project will rapidly deliver value through minimal disruption to operations.

## Technical Architecture

### System Integration
The new WellTegra AI Core will connect directly to the existing SCADA system at the Aberdeen control center. This integration ensures real-time data flow between our predictive models and the offshore well control systems. The authentication layer will be shared with the existing Active Directory to simplify user management.

### Dependencies
- SCADA System (legacy, no API documentation available)
- WellTegra AI Core (new development)
- Shared Authentication Provider
- Third-party data visualization module (vendor TBD)

### Timeline
| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Requirements Complete | Week 2 |
| Architecture Finalized | Week 4 |
| Development Complete | Week 12 |
| UAT | Week 14 |
| Go-Live | Week 16 |

## Data Handling

### Personal Data
The system will process operator names and shift schedules for workforce optimization. This data is essential for our AI to recommend optimal team compositions based on historical performance.

### Data Retention
All system logs will be retained for 7 years for audit purposes. We'll figure out the exact deletion policy during Phase 2.

### Third-Party Sharing
We share well performance data with our strategic partners to enhance model accuracy. This is standard industry practice and our partners have confirmed they handle data appropriately.

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. API integration complexity - LOW: Our team has done similar integrations before
2. Data migration effort - LOW: The data transfer will be straightforward
3. User adoption - MEDIUM: We'll provide training materials

### Mitigation Strategy
The system design includes automatic failover. If the AI Core goes down, operations can seamlessly continue through manual overrides. The shared authentication ensures no single point of entry exists.

## Compliance Statement

We are committed to maintaining high standards of operational resilience. Our incident response team can be mobilized within 24 hours of any critical issue being identified. We follow industry best practices for data protection and will ensure GDPR compliance is maintained throughout the project lifecycle.

## Financial Projections

| Year | Revenue |
|------|---------|
| Year 1 | £2.5M |
| Year 2 | £8.5M |
| Year 3 | £15M |

Based on our initial customer conversations, demand is extremely strong. Two major operators have expressed verbal interest in deploying the system across their entire North Sea portfolio.
