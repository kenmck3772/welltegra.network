## 💡 RECRUITER TALKING POINTS

### "Walk me through your portfolio"
> "I have three main systems in production:
>
> 1. **React Dashboard** at welltegra.network/app/ with voice commands, physics-informed ML, and 3D visualization. Built with React 18, TypeScript, and Three.js.
>
> 2. **Python API** on Cloud Functions integrating BigQuery for historical data and Vertex AI for predictions. All code on GitHub with testing infrastructure.
>
> 3. **Google AI Studio Apps** - I'm an early adopter with 3 deployed applications integrating Gemini AI for industrial workflows.
>
> Total value: ~$100K of production code. All deployed, all documented, all demonstrable."

### "Why transition from engineering to ML?"
> "This isn't a transition - it's a digitization. I spent 30 years making $1.2M decisions with incomplete data. Now I build systems that automate those decisions.
>
> The difference: Most ML engineers learn tools, then find problems. I had 30 years of problems, then learned tools. I know which predictions matter and what happens when models are wrong."

### "What makes you different from other ML engineers?"
> "Domain expertise as the moat. Junior devs can code. Few understand when ML predictions violate thermodynamic laws.
>
> I'm also a Google AI Studio early adopter with 3 deployed apps - Google values domain experts who can build, not just theorists."

### "Your age/experience level?"
> "I'm 55 with 30 years offshore + 5 years coding. My 'Early Career' label in development represents a deliberate **Digital Pivot**.
>
> Age is my advantage: 30 years of failures means knowing what NOT to build. Young engineers ship features. Experienced engineers ship solutions."

### "Can you start immediately?"
> "Yes. All systems are deployed and documented. I can show you the live React app right now, walk through the Python API code, and demonstrate the Google AI Studio integrations. Everything works."
