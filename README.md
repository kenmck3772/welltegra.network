# Well-Tegra | The Well From Hell Case Study

A comprehensive web-based application for well engineering analysis, real-time drilling data monitoring, and problem-solving in complex well operations.

## Overview

Well-Tegra is an interactive case study platform designed to demonstrate advanced well engineering concepts, decision-making processes, and best practices in drilling operations. This application provides hands-on experience with well planning, problem identification, and mitigation strategies based on real-world scenarios.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Interactive Well Planning**: Create and manage comprehensive well plans with detailed procedures
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live data visualization with dynamic gauges and charts
- **Problem Detection**: Automated identification of drilling problems and hazards
- **Asset Management**: Track equipment, inventory, and resources
- **Schematic Visualization**: Interactive well bore schematics with depth markers
- **Multi-Well Management**: Handle multiple wells simultaneously with detailed tracking

### üìä Data Visualization
- Real-time hookload monitoring with alert thresholds
- Depth tracking and progression charts
- Cost and time savings analysis
- Interactive gauges for critical parameters (WOB, ROP, SPP, etc.)
- Dynamic well schematic generation

### üóÉÔ∏è Data Exports
- **`data-well-666.csv`** ‚Äì Structured breakout of the "Well from Hell" metadata, intervention history, and completion design for external analysis tools.
- **`data-well-portfolio.csv`** ‚Äì Portfolio snapshot covering all featured wells with status, challenge narrative, and distilled lessons learned for quick ingestion into planning software.
- **`data-activity-cost-rates.csv`** ‚Äì Normalized intervention activity library with duration, cost, and NPT risk fields for budgeting simulations.
- **`data-equipment-tools.csv`** ‚Äì Rate card covering the intervention tool fleet with vendor assignments, standby economics, and technical specifications.
- **`data-personnel-rates.csv`** ‚Äì Staffing matrix outlining day rates, mobilization terms, and certification requirements for each role.
- The in-app <strong>Data Export Hub</strong> view provides direct download links, live record counts, schema previews, approximate file sizes, and SHA-256 fingerprints (with copy helpers) so analysts can validate integrity before importing datasets into their pipelines.
- Each dataset card now renders a 3-row preview table (first five columns) alongside inline data dictionary callouts so engineers understand field semantics immediately.
- One-click pandas, <code>curl</code>, and SQL schema copy helpers remove boilerplate when loading the datasets into notebooks, CLI scripts, or data warehouses.
- Copy helpers now drive screen-reader friendly status updates so keyboard and assistive tech users receive immediate feedback when snippets land on the clipboard.

### üé® User Experience
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Responsive design for all devices
- Intuitive navigation and workflow
- Modal-based detailed views
- Print-ready reports

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS CDN
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Inter, Roboto Mono)

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kenmck3772/welltegra.network.git
   cd welltegra.network
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No build process required!

3. **Make changes**
   Edit the `index.html` file with your preferred text editor.

### Deployment

This project can be easily deployed using GitHub Pages:

1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Select source: `main` branch
3. Click Save
4. Your site will be live at: `https://kenmck3772.github.io/welltegra.network/`

## Usage

### Navigation
- Use the top navigation bar to switch between different sections
- Plan-dependent workspaces (Live Operations, Analysis, Logistics, Commercial, HSE &amp; POB) announce why they are gated and re-route you back to the planner until a plan is generated.
- Toggle dark/light mode using the theme button
- Access detailed views through the "View Details" buttons on each well card

### Well Management
1. Click on any well card to view comprehensive details
2. Review objectives, problems, and generated plans
3. Monitor live data through interactive gauges and charts
4. Manage assets and equipment through the Asset Management tab

### Problem Analysis
- The system automatically identifies potential problems based on drilling parameters
- Problems are highlighted in red throughout the interface
- View detailed problem descriptions and recommended actions in the modal views
