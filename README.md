## 🎯 What This Is

**An honest working prototype** that demonstrates AI-augmented decision-making for offshore operations.

After 30 years in well engineering, I learned to code to see if I could build something better than the PowerPoints I kept seeing from vendors. This is the result.

### ✅ What's Actually Built

**Frontend (React):**
- Governance & Mission Control dashboard with live API integration
- Real-time DCI (Data Confidence Index) monitoring
- Multi-specialist conflict resolution interface
- HSE veto authority controls
- 11-person forensic team grid

**Backend (FastAPI on Cloud Run):**
- REST API deployed to Google Cloud Run (serverless)
- Firestore database for real-time data
- BigQuery tables ready for analytics
- Pub/Sub topics for event streaming
- DCI calculation engine

**Infrastructure (Google Cloud Platform):**
- Cloud Run: Auto-scaling serverless backend
- Firestore: Real-time database (11 team members, conflicts, alerts)
- BigQuery: Analytics-ready dataset
- Cloud Storage: Data ingestion buckets
- Cost: ~$50-75/month

### 🔨 What's NOT Built Yet

**Be clear about what's missing:**
- ❌ Not connected to real WITSML data (simulated telemetry for now)
- ❌ No authentication/multi-tenancy (open demo)
- ❌ DCI algorithm is simplified (not production-grade physics validation)
- ❌ No trained ML models deployed yet
- ❌ Conflict detection is manual trigger, not automated
- ❌ No unit/integration tests

**This is an MVP, not a product.** But it's real code running on real infrastructure that you can click and test.

---

## 🤔 The Problem I'm Exploring

Oil & gas loses significant revenue to Non-Productive Time (NPT). When you're mid-intervention and specialists disagree (drilling wants speed, HSE wants safety, CT specialist flags risk), decision-making can take hours.

What if there was a system that:
- Scored data quality in real-time (can we trust the AI?)
- Presented conflicting specialist opinions side-by-side with risk analysis
- Enforced safety-first governance (HSE veto blocks execution)
- Logged every decision for compliance

That's what this prototype demonstrates.

## 📊 What Makes This Different

### ❌ What This Is NOT:
- A bootcamp todo list with fancy CSS
- A cloned template with my name on it
- A consultant's PowerPoint mockup
- Vaporware with no code

### ✅ What This IS:
- **Real infrastructure** you can curl right now
- **Honest about limitations** (MVP, not production)
- **Domain expertise + code skills** (30 years offshore → learned FastAPI)
- **Actually deployed** (not localhost screenshots)

**The combination is rare:**
- Most offshore engineers don't code
- Most developers don't understand NPT
- Most "AI for oil & gas" is slide decks

I can do all three.

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

**Current monthly cost: ~$50-75**

| Service | Purpose | Cost |
|---------|---------|------|
| Cloud Run | API backend (serverless) | ~$10 |
| Firestore | Real-time database | ~$20 |
| BigQuery | Analytics queries | ~$10 |
| Pub/Sub | Event streaming | ~$5 |
| Cloud Storage | Data lake | ~$5 |
| Container Registry | Docker images | ~$5 |

**Why this matters:**
- Equivalent VM-based setup: $500-1000/month
- Scales to zero when idle (no wasted $)
- No Kubernetes complexity
- Production-grade services at startup prices

## 🎯 What's Next (Seeking Pilot Customer)

**Phase 2 - Make It Real:**
1. **WITSML Integration** - Connect to actual drilling data
2. **Physics-Informed DCI** - Real data quality validation (not simplified algorithm)
3. **ML Conflict Detection** - Automatic anomaly flagging
4. **Authentication** - Multi-tenant with Firebase Auth
5. **NPT Prediction** - Vertex AI model training

**I'm looking for a pilot partner willing to:**
- Provide anonymized WITSML test data
- Stress-test the DCI algorithm with real edge cases
- Validate conflict resolution logic against actual operations
- Give honest feedback (especially if I'm wrong)

**What you'd get:**
- Free access during pilot (no cost)
- Direct input on feature priority
- Working prototype customized to your operations
- No sales pitch - I want to learn if this actually helps

---

## 🤝 Why Trust This?

**I'm not a vendor.** I'm an engineer who worked the problem for 30 years and learned to code to try solving it.

**Red flags I avoid:**
- ❌ No fake testimonials ("Reduced NPT by 40%!")
- ❌ No stock photos of people in hard hats
- ❌ No "AI-powered" without showing the actual algorithm
- ❌ No "production-ready" when it's clearly an MVP

**Green flags:**
- ✅ Open source (you can read every line)
- ✅ Live demo you can break
- ✅ Honest about what doesn't work
- ✅ Real infrastructure you can curl
- ✅ Built by someone who's been stuck in hole at 3 AM
