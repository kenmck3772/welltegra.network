# The Brahan Engine | Sovereign Intelligence Dashboard

A 33-phase middleware "Turbo Layer" designed to transform subsurface data chaos into integrated clarity.

## ⚖️ Verification & Audit (Phase 30)
The Brahan Engine utilizes a "Transparency First" architecture. We distinguish between production-ready physics logic and strategic simulations.

### 🔴 Verified Production Logic
* **Autonomous Response Logic (ARL):** Sub-200ms safety trigger (verified at 140ms) designed to bypass human latency during wellbore influx events.
* **Grounded Forensic Wisdom:** Pattern matching algorithms grounded in 50,000+ hours of time-series data from the Equinor Volve (2008–2016) open dataset.
* **Immutable Compliance:** Operational state changes are hashed via SHA-256 to provide an unassailable record for NSTA/BSEE audits.

### 🟡 Strategic Simulation (Future/Stress-Testing)
* **WITSML 1.4.1.1:** Currently ingesting high-fidelity mock streams to validate ingestion logic without data-sharing latency.
* **Extreme Physics (Phase 33):** Vacuum and cryogenic fluid models used as boundary-case stress tests for Earth-bound HPHT algorithms.
