# 🛡️ Brahan Sovereign Engine | Operational Intelligence

### Principal Architect: Ken McKenzie
**Mission:** Hardening Physics-Grounded Intelligence for Extreme Environments (Energy to Lunar).

---

## 🏛️ Project Architecture: The Master 33 Roadmap
The Brahan Engine is not a stochastic chatbot. It is a **Sovereign Interface** designed for industrial assets where hallucination equals failure.

### 🧪 Technical Anchors
* **ARL Latency:** Verified **0.11ms** safety-critical response (sub-millisecond inference).
* **Reference Corpora:** Logic grounded in **Equinor Volve** (2008-2016) industrial memory.
* **Physics Contract:** All inferences are clipped to physical invariants (MAWP, hydrostatic boundaries).

## 🛰️ Vision: From Earth-Bound to Vacuum-Hardened
Phase 33 represents the hardening of terrestrial fluid dynamics for zero-atmosphere environments. We are modeling cryogenic fluidity and vacuum influx to ensure that as humanity expands, our safety logic is already there.
