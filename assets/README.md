# Assets Directory

The assets folder now carries only the files that power the live Welltegra marketing shell and the reference data used by the intervention planner.

## Active runtime assets

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `hero.mp4` | Landing page hero loop that demonstrates the live operations UI. |
| `hero-video-descriptions.vtt` | Audio description track for the hero video so the motion sequence stays accessible under CSP. |
| `logo.jpg` | Primary brand mark used for favicons, metadata, and inline badges. |
| `watermark.jpg` | Low-contrast background texture used by historical report callouts. |

## Reference files retained for future feature work

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Tool_Eqp drawings.xls.xlsx` | Legacy toolstring drawings that will feed the equipment browser and intervention templates. |

All other demo videos and archived HTML shells have been removed as part of the lean inventory initiative (#46). See `LEAN_INVENTORY.md` for the full decision log and removal summary.
