#### 1. **Tool & Equipment Catalog Integration**
**What**: Extract equipment data from Excel and v11 HTML
**Where**: Add to Planner view
**Value**: Provides visual equipment selection with technical diagrams

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Convert Excel drawings to SVG/PNG images
2. Create equipment database (JSON) with:
   - Equipment name
   - Category (fishing, running, completion, etc.)
   - Manufacturer
   - Link to diagram image
   - Typical applications
3. Add "Equipment Catalog" tab to Planner view
4. Enable drag-and-drop from catalog to procedure steps

#### 2. **Tool String Builder**
**What**: Port the "My Tool Strings" feature from v11
**Where**: New tab in Planner view
**Value**: Pre-configure reusable tool assemblies

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Extract tool string builder code from v11

3. Add save/load functionality (localStorage)
4. Enable import from Excel file

#### 3. **Service Line Templates**
**What**: Add CT/ELS/SLK/WHM specific workflows from v11
**Where**: Planner → Objectives selection
**Value**: Faster job planning with service-specific catalogs

---

### Priority 2: MEDIUM (Enhancement)

---

## Technical Extraction Tasks

### For Excel File:
```bash
# Extract all images from Excel workbook
unzip "Tool_Eqp drawings.xls.xlsx" -d extracted_equipment/

# Process drawings to PNG format (requires Python/LibreOffice)
# Convert xl/drawings/drawing*.xml to PNG images
```

### For v11 HTML:
```javascript
// Extract service catalogue data structure
// Extract tool string builder logic
// Extract cost calculation formulas
// Modernize UI components to v23 style
```

---

## File Naming Recommendation

Consider renaming files for clarity:
- `assets/DOCTYPE html` → `assets/welltegra-v11-legacy.html`
- `assets/Tool_Eqp drawings.xls.xlsx` → `assets/equipment-catalog-drawings.xlsx`

---

## Conclusion

**Both files are HIGHLY VALUABLE and should be integrated into v23.**

The Excel file provides a comprehensive equipment catalog that's currently missing from the application, while the v11 HTML contains proven UI patterns and features (tool string builder, detailed service catalogues) that would significantly enhance the current version.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Extract equipment data from Excel file
2. Port tool string builder from v11
3. Create equipment catalog UI in v23
4. Link equipment diagrams to procedures
5. Add service-line specific templates

**Estimated Development Time:** 2-3 days for Priority 1 features

**Business Value:** High - Reduces planning time, improves accuracy, provides visual reference material
