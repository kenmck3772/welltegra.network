# WellTegra Demo Program Runbook

As the intervention lead showcasing WellTegra to senior management, we need a structured flow that mirrors how an offshore supervisor would actually progress from discovery to execution approval. This runbook anchors the demo to a 30-minute slot but can be compressed to 15 minutes when time-boxed.

## 1. Executive Framing (3 minutes)
- **Outcome statement:** “WellTegra compresses intervention planning from days to hours while hardening Management of Change compliance.”
- **Reference asset:** W666 “The Perfect Storm” – highlight compound integrity, scale, and safety valve failures.
- **Key metrics call-out:** 30% NPT reduction target, 2–3 hours/day engineering time reclaimed, integrated AI procedure generation.

## 2. Data Intake & Well Context (5 minutes)
1. Land on the **Home** view and showcase the ROI slider widgets – quantify potential savings for the visitor’s asset base.
2. Navigate to the **Planner** and select W666. Stress how the dossier blends historical failures, casing schema, and operational lessons.
3. Open the **Well History modal** to demonstrate traceability: slickline surveillance failures, DHSV issues, and regulatory shut-in context.

## 3. Objective Selection & AI Advisor (7 minutes)
1. Walk through manual objectives to prove deterministic control (expandable casing patch, scale remediation).
2. Enable the **AI Advisor** and pick “Restore full-bore access” to surface Gemini-backed recommendations.
3. Select an AI recommendation and show the **Engineering Blueprint**: conceptual drivers, detailed execution envelopes, contingency envelope.
4. Emphasize validation hooks – highlight where WellTegra checks OD/ID compatibility and procedural feasibility before execution.

## 4. Integrated Program Generation (5 minutes)
1. Generate the program and step into **Step 4** of the planner.
2. Review the consolidated procedure, risk register, and cost roll-up.
3. Demonstrate the **Data Integrity fingerprints** and how the plan broadcast updates the Mobile Communicator snapshot (point to the badge updating in real time).

## 5. Management of Change & Remote Approvals (4 minutes)
1. Launch the **Mobile Communicator** overlay.
2. Show a pending sour-service pack-off swap and walk through the secure sign-off (email + PIN + digital seal).
3. Highlight how approvals stamp timelines, sync back to the planner, and feed the activity log.

## 6. Operational Readiness & Live Execution (4 minutes)
1. Advance to **Step 5** and surface logistics + commercial readiness: vendor scorecard, personnel mobilization, equipment sourcing.
2. Switch to the **Performer (Live Ops)** view: demonstrate KPI gauges, anomaly alerts, and the operations log workflow.
3. Mention the **Analyzer** view for post-job insight and PDF exports as the natural follow-on once the campaign closes.

## 7. Closing & Next Steps (2 minutes)
- Summarize three differentiators: unified data fabric, AI-assisted procedure authoring, and governed remote approvals.
- Offer security deep dive referencing the dedicated **Security** view and Enterprise Managed Users roadmap.
- Call-to-action: align on pilot scope (one critical intervention well + 4-6 week onboarding).

## Optional Tailoring Modules
- **Sustainability storyline:** Use the sustainability calculator to quantify CO₂ savings when optimizing rig time and chemical usage.
- **Economic sensitivity:** Adjust service-rate tables to show commercial impact of different vendor strategies.
- **Procedure varianting:** Duplicate AI recommendations to demonstrate scenario planning (e.g., chemical-only vs mechanical/chemical hybrid).

**Demo logistics checklist**
- Pre-load browser localStorage with communicator data (use current defaults).
- Confirm hero video autoplay works on the presentation laptop.
- Keep a PDF export pre-generated in case of offline questions about report formatting.
