# Well Completion Report - Well 44

## Executive Summary

**Well Name:** The Sandstorm (Case Study)
**Well ID:** 44
**API Number:** GB-SEER-44-BRAH-2015
**Field:** Brahan Field, Block 22/17a
**Operator:** Hess Corporation (48.5%)
**Completion Date:** August 15, 2015
**First Production:** September 1, 2015
**Current Status:** ✅ Active - Restored Production

### Well Significance
This well demonstrates successful remediation of catastrophic sand production from an unconsolidated reservoir. In August 2023, the standalone sand screen failed due to erosion, leading to severe sand production that damaged surface equipment (3 choke replacements in 6 months). A through-tubing expandable sand screen patch was successfully installed in September 2023, eliminating sand production and restoring the well to full capacity.

## 10. Key Learnings & Case Study Value

### Sand Production Challenge
This well produces from an unconsolidated reservoir with excellent porosity (28-32%) and permeability (800-1200 mD) but poor formation consolidation. Over 8 years of continuous production, the original wire-wrapped sand screen eroded, leading to catastrophic sand production:

**Problem Severity (Aug 2023 - Sep 2023):**
- Sand production: >10% by volume
- Surface choke replacements: 3 in 6 months ($540K)
- Production choked back: 60% capacity to limit damage
- Deferred production: $2.5M over 6 months
- Total impact: ~$3.3M in 6 months

### Through-Tubing Remediation Success
Rather than conducting a full workover to replace the completion, a through-tubing expandable sand screen patch was successfully deployed:

**Patch Advantages:**
1. **No Workover Required:** Installed through 3.958" tubing ID
2. **Rapid Deployment:** 2-day operation vs. 18+ day workover
3. **Cost Effective:** $850K vs. $8-12M workover
4. **Finer Mesh:** 100-micron mesh better matched to formation
5. **Conformable:** Expandable design conforms to failed screen geometry

**Results:**
- ✅ Zero sand production since installation (12+ months)
- ✅ Production restored to 100% capacity
- ✅ No surface equipment erosion
- ✅ Well life extended 10+ years
- ✅ **Cost savings: $7-11M**
- ✅ **ROI: 8-13x**

### Value to Well-Tegra Platform
**"The Sandstorm"** demonstrates:
1. **Early Detection:** Production surveillance identified screen failure early
2. **Through-Tubing Solutions:** Avoid workover costs with innovative technology
3. **Sand Control Optimization:** Match screen design to formation characteristics
4. **Equipment Damage Prevention:** Surface equipment protected from erosion
5. **Production Optimization:** Restore full capacity without workover

**Key Insight:** Unconsolidated reservoirs require ongoing sand control integrity monitoring. Through-tubing expandable patches provide a cost-effective remediation option when original sand screens fail, avoiding multi-million dollar workovers while restoring full production.
