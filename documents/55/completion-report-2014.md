## 10. Key Learnings & Case Study Value

### Paraffin Wax Deposition Challenge
Waxy crude oil contains dissolved paraffin wax at reservoir temperature (180°F). As the oil flows up the wellbore and cools, the temperature eventually drops below the cloud point (85-95°F), causing wax to crystallize and deposit on tubing walls. Over time, these deposits accumulate and can completely block production.

**Well 55 Wax Deposition Timeline:**
- **2014-2023:** Gradual wax buildup (undetected)
- **2023-2024:** Accelerated deposition due to pressure/temperature decline
- **Jan 15, 2024:** Production stopped - 100% blockage at 6,000 ft

### Remediation Strategy: Chemical + Mechanical
The successful removal required a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Chemical Dissolution**
- Heated xylene-based dissolver (180-200°F)
- 24-hour soak time to soften wax
- Result: Partial dissolution, enabling mechanical access

**Phase 2: Mechanical Scraping**
- Coiled tubing with scraper tool
- 12 passes through blockage zone
- Hot oil circulation during scraping
- Result: Complete wax removal

**Success Factors:**
1. ✅ Heated chemicals above wax melting point
2. ✅ Extended soak time for penetration
3. ✅ Mechanical scraping for complete removal
4. ✅ Hot oil circulation to prevent re-deposition
5. ✅ Fast execution (2 days operation)

### Wax Prevention Program (Post-Remediation)
To prevent recurrence, a comprehensive wax management program was implemented:

**1. Chemical Inhibitor Program**
- **Method:** Continuous downhole injection via capillary string
- **Chemical:** Crystal modifier (prevents wax nucleation)
- **Injection Rate:** 1 gallon per day
- **Installation Date:** February 5, 2024
- **Effectiveness:** Zero wax deposition since installation (9+ months)

**2. Production Optimization**
- **Higher Flow Rates:** Maintain turbulent flow to limit deposition
- **Choke Management:** Optimize to keep wellbore temp above cloud point
- **Hot Oil Treatments:** Quarterly preventive hot oil flushes

**3. Monitoring Program**
- **Production Surveillance:** Daily rate monitoring for decline
- **Pressure Monitoring:** Identify restriction via pressure buildup
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Track wellbore temp profile
- **Quarterly CT Runs:** Inspection + preventive scraping if needed

**Results (9 Months Post-Remediation):**
- ✅ Zero production restrictions
- ✅ Stable 800 BOPD production
- ✅ No wax-related issues
- ✅ Prevention cost: $120K/year vs. $650K remediation
- ✅ Payback: Continuous production vs. costly interventions

### Value to Well-Tegra Platform
**"The Wax Plug"** demonstrates:
1. **Early Detection:** Production surveillance caught blockage early
2. **Dual Approach:** Chemical + mechanical for complete removal
3. **Prevention:** Continuous chemical inhibition prevents recurrence
4. **Cost Avoidance:** $650K remediation vs. $5-7M workover
5. **Production Optimization:** Maintain capacity with prevention program

**ROI on Prevention Program:**
- **Annual Prevention Cost:** $120K (chemical inhibitor + monitoring)
- **Avoided Remediation:** $650K per event
- **Avoided Deferred Production:** $425K per event (15 days NPT)
- **ROI:** 9x annual return if prevents one intervention per year

**Key Insight:** For waxy crude producers, a continuous chemical inhibition program is far more cost-effective than periodic remediation. Early detection through production surveillance and proactive prevention are essential for optimizing well economics.
