## Executive Summary

### Problem
Original TRSSV (Tubing Retrievable Subsurface Safety Valve) failed during routine function test on February 18, 2024. Valve stuck in open position, eliminating primary subsurface safety barrier. North Sea regulations require immediate remediation.

### Solution
Install wireline retrievable insert valve (WRSV) inside the failed TRSSV. This avoids costly workover to replace tubing string while restoring full safety barrier function.

### Cost Comparison
- **Insert Valve Approach:** $450K (2 days)
- **Workover Alternative:** $6-8M (14+ days)
- **Cost Savings:** $5.5-7.5M
- **ROI:** 12-17x

## Intervention Execution Summary

### Day 1: March 19, 2024 - TRSSV Lockopen

#### Failed TRSSV Assessment
- ✅ **Failure Mode:** Internal spring mechanism failure
- ✅ **Position:** Stuck partially closed (30% open)
- ✅ **Action Required:** Mechanically lock open to allow insert valve passage

#### Lockopen Procedure
1. **0800-1000:** Rig up wireline (Baker Hughes)
2. **1000-1200:** RIH with lockopen tool to 1,500 ft
3. **1200-1400:** Mechanical lockopen sequence
   - Tool engages TRSSV internal mechanism
   - Apply 15,000 lbs force to lock valve open
   - **1330:** TRSSV successfully locked in open position ✅
4. **1400-1600:** Retrieve lockopen tool and verify
   - **Result:** TRSSV locked open, full bore access confirmed ✅

### Day 2: March 20, 2024 - Insert Valve Installation

#### Insert Valve Specifications
- **Manufacturer:** Baker Hughes
- **Model:** WRSV-Insert-HT
- **Serial:** BH-WRSV-24-5521
- **Setting Depth:** 1,500 ft MD (inside failed TRSSV)
- **OD:** 3.5" (fits inside 4.5" tubing)
- **Bore ID:** 2.75"
- **Pressure Rating:** 10,000 psi
- **Temperature Rating:** 300°F
- **Type:** Wireline retrievable (no workover required for future replacement)

#### Installation Sequence
1. **0800-1000:** Insert valve preparation and function test
   - Surface cycle test: Open/Close 10 times ✅
   - Hydraulic control line test: 3,000 psi ✅
   - Retrieval tool connection verified ✅

2. **1000-1230:** RIH with insert valve on wireline
   - Valve rigged in "running" (open) position
   - Control line deployed alongside wireline
   - **1130:** Pass through TRSSV at 1,500 ft
   - **1200:** Valve positioned at setting depth (1,500 ft ±3 ft)
   - **1215:** CCL depth correlation confirms position ✅

3. **1230-1400:** Setting and Testing
   - **1230:** Activate setting tool (hydraulic sequence)
   - **1245:** Insert valve anchored inside TRSSV body ✅
   - **1300:** Hydraulic control line connection verified
   - **1315:** Function test #1: Close valve from surface
     - **Result:** CLOSED successfully ✅
   - **1330:** Function test #2: Open valve from surface
     - **Result:** OPENED successfully ✅
   - **1345:** Function test #3: Close and hold 5,000 psi differential
     - **Result:** PASSED - zero leakage ✅

4. **1400-1600:** Final Verification
   - **1400:** Release wireline retrieval tool
   - **1430:** POOH with wireline
   - **1500:** Well returned to production
   - **1530:** Production flowing at 2,800 BOPD (full capacity) ✅

## Results

### Technical Success
| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Setting Depth** | 1,500 ft ±5 ft | 1,500 ft ✅ | PASS |
| **Function Test** | 10 cycles | 10 cycles ✅ | PASS |
| **Pressure Test** | 5,000 psi | 5,000 psi ✅ | PASS |
| **Zero Leakage** | 0 psi drop | 0 psi drop ✅ | PASS |
| **Duration** | <3 days | 2 days ✅ | PASS |

### Business Impact
- **Primary Barrier Restored:** ✅ Yes (regulatory requirement met)
- **Production Downtime:** 2 days (vs. 14+ for workover)
- **Cost Savings:** $5.5-7.5M
- **Well Life:** No impact (insert valve is wireline retrievable for easy future replacement)

## Key Learnings

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Lockopen Tool:** Successfully locked failed TRSSV open on first attempt
2. **Insert Valve Technology:** Wireline deployment = fast, low-cost
3. **Function Tests:** 100% pass rate on all tests
4. **Production Recovery:** Full capacity restored in 2 days
5. **Regulatory Compliance:** NSTA approved approach - barrier requirements met

### Future Advantage
**Wireline Retrievable Design:**
- Future SSSV replacements can be done in 1 day
- No workover rig required
- Cost: ~$150K per replacement
- Timeline: 12-24 hours
- **10-15 year valve life = zero workover costs over well life**
