## The Challenge

### Three Simultaneous Integrity Issues (July 2023)
After 10 years of continuous production from this deepwater HPHT well, three critical issues developed:

1. **Casing Deformation** (9,200 ft MD)
   - Production casing ovalized from 8.681" ID to 7.8" ID
   - Unable to pass full toolstrings
   - Restricting all future intervention capability

2. **SSSV Failure** (2,800 ft MD)
   - Primary subsurface safety valve failed during routine test
   - Stuck in open position
   - Primary safety barrier compromised (regulatory issue)

3. **Sand Production Risk**
   - Unconsolidated zone beginning to produce trace sand
   - Risk of catastrophic sand production and equipment damage
   - Requires sand control installation

### Traditional Approach: Subsea Workover
```
Cost: $15-25M
Duration: 30-45 days
Deferred Production: $20-30M @ 6,500 BOPD
Total Impact: $35-55M
```

### Well-Tegra AI-Assisted Approach: Sequential Interventions
```
Cost: $2.05M
Duration: 9 days (3 campaigns)
Deferred Production: $5.8M (9 days NPT)
Total Impact: $7.85M

SAVINGS: $27-47M (3.5-7x)
```

## AI-Assisted Planning Process

### Problem: What Sequence?
**Question:** Which intervention should be performed first, second, third?

**AI Analysis Factors:**
1. **Dependency Mapping:** Which issues block others?
2. **Risk Assessment:** What failure modes exist?
3. **Cost Optimization:** Vessel selection and mobilization efficiency
4. **Technology Selection:** What tools can pass through restrictions?
5. **Regulatory Priority:** Safety barriers vs. production optimization

### AI Recommendation: Three Sequential Campaigns

**Campaign 1: Casing Patch (August 21, 2023)**
- **Why First?** Must restore tool access BEFORE other interventions
- **Logic:** SSSV insert valve and sand screen cannot pass through 7.8" restriction
- **Technology:** 40-ft expandable casing patch
- **Result:** ID restored to 8.45" - enables Campaigns 2 & 3 ✅

**Campaign 2: SSSV Insert Valve (September 5, 2023)**
- **Why Second?** Regulatory priority - restore primary safety barrier
- **Logic:** Quick wireline job (3 days) + critical barrier requirement
- **Technology:** Wireline retrievable insert valve inside failed SSSV
- **Result:** Primary barrier restored ✅

**Campaign 3: Sand Screen Installation (September 15, 2023)**
- **Why Third?** Requires full bore access + most complex operation
- **Logic:** Sand control is production optimization, not immediate safety risk
- **Technology:** Through-tubing premium sand screen
- **Result:** Zero sand production ✅

**Key Insight:** The AI determined that attempting any other sequence would either:
- Fail (tools can't pass restriction)
- Cost more (require workover rig)
- Take longer (serial dependencies)

   - RIH with WRSV insert valve (Baker Hughes)
   - Setting depth: 2,800 ft MD (inside failed SSSV body)
   - Wireline retrievable design (no workover for future replacement)
4. **Function Testing:**
   - Close valve from surface: ✅ Success
   - Hold 5,000 psi differential: ✅ Success (zero leakage)
   - Open valve from surface: ✅ Success
5. **NSTA Verification:** Remote ROV inspection + pressure test data submitted

**Result:** ✅ Primary safety barrier restored (regulatory requirement met)

### Campaign 3: Sand Screen Installation (September 15, 2023)

**Vessel:** Light Well Intervention Vessel (re-mobilized)
**Duration:** 5 days
**Cost:** $900K

#### Execution
1. **ROV Intervention:** Open subsea tree
2. **CT Deployment:** 2.875" coiled tubing (larger for screen delivery)
3. **Screen Installation:**
   - Through-tubing premium sand screen (Halliburton)
   - Setting depth: 17,500 ft MD (above perforations at 19,050 ft)
   - Mesh size: 150 micron (matched to formation sand characteristics)
   - Expandable design: 4.5" unexpanded → 7.5" expanded
4. **Hydraulic Expansion:**
   - Expansion pressure: 3,500 psi
   - Screen conforms to wellbore geometry
   - Full coverage of production interval
5. **Production Testing:**
   - Open well to production
   - **Result:** Zero sand at surface ✅
   - Production rate: 6,500 BOPD (peak performance) ✅

**Result:** ✅ Sand control established - Zero sand production

## Key Learnings: The Power of AI-Assisted Planning

### What the AI Got Right ✅
1. **Sequence Optimization:** Casing patch MUST be first (enables everything else)
2. **Vessel Selection:** Light well intervention vessel vs. full workover rig ($2M vs. $20M)
3. **Technology Matching:** Through-tubing solutions for all three interventions
4. **Timing:** 3 separate campaigns more efficient than 1 massive workover
5. **Cost Savings:** $27-47M saved through intelligent planning

### Human vs. AI Decision-Making

**Without AI (Traditional Approach):**
- "Three big problems = workover rig required"
- Single massive campaign: $35-55M
- 30-45 days downtime
- High risk consolidated into one operation

**With AI (Well-Tegra Approach):**
- "Analyze dependencies, optimize sequence, select technologies"
- Three targeted campaigns: $7.85M total
- 9 days total downtime
- Risks distributed and managed independently

**The Difference:** AI analyzed 10,000+ historical interventions, identified the optimal sequence, and saved $27-47M.

## The "Field of Dreams" Name

**Why This Name?**
> "If you build it, they will come." - Field of Dreams (1989)

This well earned its name by demonstrating that with **proper planning and technology selection**, even the most complex multi-issue interventions can be executed cost-effectively WITHOUT massive workovers.

**The Dream:** AI-assisted planning makes the impossible possible.

**The Reality:** $27-47M saved. Well at peak performance. Zero issues after 12+ months.
