## 10. Key Learnings & Case Study Value

### Scale Deposition Challenge
This well experienced complete production blockage due to severe barium sulfate (BaSO₄) scale deposition at 9,200 ft. The scale bridge extended 120 ft and was composed of >97% hard BaSO₄, one of the most challenging scale types to remove.

### Remediation Success
The successful removal of the scale bridge using a combination of:
1. **Chemical Treatment:** 48-hour DTPA soak to soften scale
2. **Mechanical Treatment:** High-pressure coiled tubing jetting to break up and remove scale

**Results:**
- ✅ Complete scale removal achieved
- ✅ Production restored to 100% capacity
- ✅ Well returned to service within 38 days of discovery
- ✅ Avoided workover rig costs (~$5-8M savings)

### Value to Well-Tegra Platform
**"The Scale Trap"** demonstrates:
1. **Early Detection:** Production decline monitoring identified issue before permanent damage
2. **Optimal Treatment Planning:** AI-assisted chemical selection and concentration optimization
3. **Cost Efficiency:** $750K remediation vs. $5-8M workover
4. **Production Recovery:** Well returned to full capacity

**ROI:** 7-11x return on remediation investment

### Scale Prevention
Following remediation, the well is now on a scale inhibitor injection program to prevent recurrence:
- **Inhibitor Type:** Phosphonate-based scale inhibitor
- **Injection Rate:** Continuous downhole injection via capillary string
- **Effectiveness:** No scale detected since Feb 2024
- **Monitoring:** Monthly production tracking + annual scale squeeze treatments
