   - Validation checks passed
   - Range verification
   - Format compliance

3. **Consistency** (25% weight)
   - Cross-source matching
   - Relationship validation
   - Temporal consistency

4. **Timeliness** (20% weight)
   - Data freshness
   - Update frequency
   - Latency measurement

**Overall Score Calculation:**
```
Quality Score = (Completeness × 0.25) + (Accuracy × 0.30) +
                (Consistency × 0.25) + (Timeliness × 0.20)
```

### Quality Indicators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Plan-dependent workspace gated"

**Problem**: Clicking Performer, Analyzer, or other views shows "Please generate a plan first"

**Solution**:
1. Navigate to Planner
2. Select a well
3. Choose objective
4. Generate plan
5. Now access other views

**Why**: Well-Tegra requires a plan context for live operations and analysis.

---

#### Issue: Data Quality shows red/poor

**Problem**: Wells display low quality scores (🔴 <50%)

**Solution**:
1. Click Data Quality Dashboard
2. Review specific quality issues
3. Address missing data
4. Verify data sources
5. Re-sync data
6. Check WITSML connection

**Why**: Poor data quality indicates missing or invalid data that could lead to incorrect decisions.

---

#### Issue: Gauges not updating

**Problem**: Live operations gauges show static values

**Solution**:
1. Check if simulation is running (Play/Pause button)
2. Verify WITSML connection active
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
5. Check network connection

**Why**: Gauges require either active simulation or real-time data feed.

---

#### Issue: PDF export fails

**Problem**: Clicking PDF export shows error or nothing happens

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify jsPDF library loaded: Open console, type `window.jspdf`
3. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Disable browser extensions
5. Check popup blocker settings

**Why**: PDF generation requires JavaScript libraries that may be blocked.

---

#### Issue: CSP violations in console

**Problem**: Console shows "Content Security Policy" errors

**Solution**:
- These are warnings, not blocking errors
- Site still functions normally
- Developers working on fix
- Can be safely ignored

**Why**: Inline styles need to be moved to external CSS for strict security policies.

---

#### Issue: Theme not saving

**Problem**: Theme resets to light mode on page reload

**Solution**:
1. Check browser allows localStorage
2. Check private browsing mode (disables storage)
3. Check browser settings for site data
4. Try clearing cache and setting again

**Why**: Theme preference stored in browser localStorage.

---

#### Issue: Mobile Communicator empty

**Problem**: No approval requests shown

**Solution**:
- This is normal in demo mode
- Approval requests appear when plans require MOC
- Try generating a plan with high-risk activities

**Why**: Demo version doesn't have pre-loaded requests.

---

#### Issue: Equipment catalog not loading

**Problem**: Equipment browser shows no items

**Solution**:
1. Check network connection
2. Verify `equipment-catalog.json` accessible
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try refreshing page
5. Clear browser cache

**Why**: Catalog loads from JSON file that may be cached or blocked.

---

#### Issue: Slow performance

**Problem**: Page loads slowly or becomes unresponsive

**Solution**:
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check system resources (Task Manager)
4. Try different browser
5. Check network speed
6. Disable browser extensions

**Why**: Charts and real-time updates can be resource-intensive.

---

#### Issue: WITSML connection fails

**Problem**: Cannot connect to WITSML server

**Solution**:
1. Verify server URL correct
2. Check username and password
3. Verify WITSML version match
4. Check server is accessible (ping test)
5. Check firewall settings
6. Contact server administrator

**Why**: WITSML requires proper authentication and network access.
