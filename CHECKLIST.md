# Audit Checklist ‚Äî WellTegra Static Site

## Console Output

Summary of console captures this pass:

| Page | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.html` (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html`) | ‚úÖ Clean console | Served via `python3 -m http.server 8000`; Playwright headless Chromium capture. Only the informational bootstrap log below printed. |
| Archived demos (`index-v23-fresh.html`, `test-v23-1761097711.html`) | ‚è≥ Deferred | Not exercised this pass so the homepage regression could finish first. |

```text
log: Cost data loaded: {equipment: 37, personnel: 35, activities: 30}
```

## Data Integrity

| Artifact | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `equipment-catalog.json` | ‚úÖ Valid JSON | `python -m json.tool equipment-catalog.json` (no syntax errors; pretty-print succeeded). |
| `service-line-templates.json` | ‚úÖ Valid JSON | `python -m json.tool service-line-templates.json` confirmed the structure without warnings. |
| `data-activity-cost-rates.csv` | ‚úÖ Parsed (31 rows) | Row-count script (`python - <<'PY'`) read every record without raising CSV errors. |
| `data-equipment-tools.csv` | ‚úÖ Parsed (38 rows) | Same script counted 38 rows, matching the expected tool catalog footprint. |
| `data-personnel-rates.csv` | ‚úÖ Parsed (36 rows) | CSV reader completed successfully; no malformed rows encountered. |

Command + output for the combined CSV check:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import csv
from pathlib import Path
for path in [
    Path('data-activity-cost-rates.csv'),
    Path('data-equipment-tools.csv'),
    Path('data-personnel-rates.csv'),
]:
    with path.open(newline='') as handle:
        reader = csv.reader(handle)
        row_count = sum(1 for _ in reader)
    print(f"{path}: {row_count} rows")
PY
```

```text
data-activity-cost-rates.csv: 31 rows
data-equipment-tools.csv: 38 rows
data-personnel-rates.csv: 36 rows
```

## Link Health

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run lint:links` | ‚úÖ Clean crawl | 14 URLs, 0 failures against `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Reminder: start `python3 -m http.server 8000` first to avoid false positives on the site root. |

Command output:

```text
ü§ñ Successfully scanned 14 links in 0.943 seconds.
```

## Styling Pipeline

- [x] `npm run build:css`
  - Tailwind CLI rebuild succeeded; output written to `assets/css/tailwind.css`.

## Performance Snapshot

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npx lighthouse ‚Ä¶` | üö´ Blocked | The container image ships without Chrome/Chromium, so the CLI exited with `The CHROME_PATH environment variable must be set‚Ä¶`. Rerun on a host with a browser binary. |

## Accessibility & SEO Opportunities

Top opportunities to monitor:

| # | Action | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Remove the duplicated "Review the strategic roadmap source" link in `index.html` (lines 1396‚Äì1399). | ‚úÖ Completed | Anchor removed so the Verifiable Trust callout exposes a single focus target. |
| 2 | Confirm hero media fallbacks announce state changes via `aria-live`. | ‚è≥ Deferred | Needs telemetry scripting follow-up; no regression observed in this pass. |
| 3 | Audit heading hierarchy in the Unified Command Center overlays. | üìã Backlog | Check `h2`/`h3` ordering during the next overlay iteration. |
| 4 | Add descriptive alt text for non-decorative marketing imagery. | üìã Backlog | Decorative waveforms already `aria-hidden`; remaining imagery still needs richer alt copy. |
| 5 | Double-check canonical URLs across archived demos. | ‚úÖ Verified | All canonical tags point at `https://welltegra.network`. |
| 6 | Ensure `data-switch-view` CTA buttons preserve focus outlines. | ‚úÖ Verified | Buttons retain default focus ring styling. |
| 7 | Keep CSP directives single-sourced per page. | ‚úÖ Verified | Each HTML document now carries a single authoritative CSP `<meta>`. |
| 8 | Maintain SRI hashes for Chart.js, jsPDF, and html2canvas. | ‚úÖ Verified | Hashes and `crossorigin` attributes audited in `index.html`. |
| 9 | Continue pinning CDN dependencies to exact versions. | ‚úÖ Verified | External scripts specify exact version numbers. |
| 10 | Resume Lighthouse accessibility/SEO audits once Chrome is available. | üö´ Blocked | Lighthouse CLI requires a Chromium binary; rerun outside the container. |

## Security Hygiene

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSP `<meta>` directives | ‚úÖ Verified | Default/script/style sources scoped to trusted origins; duplicates removed. |
| External script SRI hashes | ‚úÖ Verified | Chart.js, jsPDF, and html2canvas retain `integrity` + `crossorigin`. |
| `target="_blank"` anchors | ‚úÖ Verified | All external tabs include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. |
