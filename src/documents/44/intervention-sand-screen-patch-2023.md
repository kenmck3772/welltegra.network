## Document Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Well ID** | 44 (The Sandstorm) |
| **Procedure Type** | Through-Tubing Sand Screen Patch |
| **Date Executed** | September 10, 2023 |
| **Duration** | 2 days |
| **Outcome** | ✅ SUCCESS - Zero sand production |
| **Service Company** | Halliburton |
| **Cost** | $850K |

---

## Problem

**Screen Failure:** Original wire-wrapped sand screen (installed 2015) failed due to erosion after 8 years of service. Severe sand production (>10% by volume) damaged surface equipment:
- 3 surface choke replacements in 6 months ($540K)
- Production choked back to 40% capacity
- $2.5M deferred production over 6 months

**Root Cause:** Unconsolidated reservoir (50-150 micron sand) + inadequate original screen design (wire-wrapped insufficient for formation characteristics).

## Solution

**Through-Tubing Expandable Sand Screen Patch**
- **Manufacturer:** Halliburton
- **Model:** Through-Tubing Expandable Screen Patch
- **Serial:** HAL-SCREEN-23-9921
- **Setting Depth:** 9,850 ft MD
- **Mesh Size:** 100 micron (finer than original, matched to formation)
- **Installation Method:** Coiled tubing deployment + hydraulic expansion

**Advantages vs. Workover:**
- ✅ Installed through 3.958" tubing ID (no workover required)
- ✅ Cost: $850K vs. $8-12M workover
- ✅ Duration: 2 days vs. 18+ days
- ✅ ROI: 9-14x

## Execution Summary

### Day 1: September 10, 2023
1. **0800-1200:** RIH with screen patch on 2.375" CT
   - Patch in collapsed state (OD: 3.5")
   - Pass through tubing (ID: 3.958") successfully
   - Position at 9,850 ft MD (failed screen location)

2. **1200-1600:** Hydraulic Expansion
   - Expansion pressure: 3,000 psi
   - Screen expands from 3.5" OD to 7.5" OD
   - Conforms to failed original screen
   - **1530:** Expansion complete ✅

3. **1600-1800:** Initial Testing
   - Pressure test: 5,000 psi (30 min hold) ✅
   - Zero leakage confirmed ✅

### Day 2: September 11, 2023
1. **0800-1200:** Verification
   - RIH with caliper tool
   - Screen geometry confirmed: 7.5" OD, uniform
   - 100-micron mesh integrity verified ✅

2. **1200-1600:** Production Restart
   - Open SSSV and wing valve
   - **1400:** Well flowing at 2,500 BOPD
   - Returns: **ZERO SAND** ✅

## Results

### Technical Success
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Sand Production** | >10% | 0% | 100% ✅ |
| **Production Rate** | 1,000 BOPD (choked) | 2,500 BOPD | +150% ✅ |
| **Choke Erosion** | 3 replacements/6mo | Zero (12+ months) | 100% ✅ |

### 12-Month Performance (Post-Intervention)
- ✅ **Zero sand detected** at surface (12+ months)
- ✅ **Production stable** at 2,500 BOPD
- ✅ **No surface equipment erosion**
- ✅ **Screen integrity:** Perfect (no failures)

### Cost-Benefit
```
Intervention Cost: $850,000
Alternative (Workover): $8-12M
Cost Savings: $7.15-11.15M
ROI: 8.4-13.1x
Payback: 13 days
```
