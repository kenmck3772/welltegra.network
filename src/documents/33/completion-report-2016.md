**Completion Date:** June 8, 2016
**First Production:** June 20, 2016
**Current Status:** ✅ Active - Restored Production

### Well Significance
This well demonstrates successful remediation of a failed primary safety barrier (SSSV). In February 2024, the tubing retrievable subsurface safety valve (TRSSV) failed during routine testing and became locked in the open position. Rather than conducting a costly workover to replace the tubing string, a wireline retrievable insert valve was successfully installed inside the failed valve in March 2024, restoring the primary safety barrier function.

## 10. Key Learnings & Case Study Value

### Safety Valve Failure Challenge
In February 2024, the original TRSSV failed during routine 6-month function testing. The valve became stuck in the open position, eliminating the primary subsurface safety barrier. Under North Sea regulations, this is a critical integrity issue requiring immediate remediation.

### Cost-Effective Solution: Insert Valve Technology
Rather than conducting a full workover to replace the tubing string (which would include pulling 9,600 ft of tubing), the operations team selected an innovative wireline retrievable insert valve approach:

**Traditional Workover Approach:**
- ❌ Cost: $6-8M
- ❌ Duration: 14+ days NPT
- ❌ Requires workover rig and crew
- ❌ Higher HSE risk (more operations)

**Insert Valve Approach:**
- ✅ Cost: $450K
- ✅ Duration: 2 days NPT
- ✅ Wireline operation only
- ✅ Lower HSE risk
- ✅ Can be replaced in future without workover

### Remediation Success
**Installation:** March 20, 2024
**Testing:** September 15, 2024 - ✅ PASSED
**Result:** Primary safety barrier fully restored

**Cost Savings:** $5.5-7.5M (vs. workover)
**ROI:** 12-17x return on investment

### Value to Well-Tegra Platform
**"The Broken Barrier"** demonstrates:
1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Maintained NSTA barrier requirements without workover
2. **Cost Optimization:** Insert valve technology vs. traditional workover
3. **Rapid Response:** Problem identified → solution implemented in 30 days
4. **Future-Proofed:** Wireline retrievable design enables easy future replacements

**Key Insight:** Not all downhole equipment failures require expensive workovers. Insert valve technology provides a cost-effective alternative for SSSV failures while maintaining full safety and regulatory compliance.
