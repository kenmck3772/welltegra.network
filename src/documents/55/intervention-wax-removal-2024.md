## Problem

**Wax Blockage:** 180-ft paraffin wax plug completely blocked production at 6,000 ft MD. 
- **Composition:** C24-C36 paraffin wax (heavy long-chain hydrocarbons)
- **Cloud Point:** 85-95°F (wax crystallizes below this temp)
- **Impact:** 100% production blockage (zero flow)
- **Duration:** 15 days from discovery to remediation
- **Deferred Production:** $425K

**Root Cause:** Waxy crude oil (12-18% wax content) + wellbore cooling below cloud point (85°F) at ~6,000 ft depth = wax deposition on tubing walls over time.

---

## Solution

**Two-Phase Approach:**

### Phase 1: Chemical Dissolution
- **Chemical:** Heated xylene-based paraffin dissolver
- **Temperature:** 180-200°F (above wax melting point)
- **Volume:** 85 barrels
- **Soak Time:** 24 hours
- **Result:** Partial wax softening

### Phase 2: Mechanical Removal  
- **Tool:** Coiled tubing (2.375" OD) + mechanical scraper
- **Method:** 12 passes through blockage with hot oil circulation
- **Temperature:** 180°F circulation fluid
- **Result:** Complete wax removal

## Execution Summary

### Day 1: February 1, 2024 - Chemical Treatment
1. **0800-1200:** CT RIH to wax bridge at 6,000 ft
2. **1200-1600:** Pump 85 bbls heated xylene dissolver (180°F)
3. **1600-2400:** 24-hour soak period (chemical penetration)

### Day 2: February 2, 2024 - Mechanical Scraping
1. **0800-1000:** CT RIH with mechanical scraper tool
2. **1000-1500:** 12 scraping passes through blockage zone
   - **Pass 1-3:** Heavy wax returns (scraper breaking through)
   - **Pass 4-8:** Moderate wax returns (widening hole)
   - **Pass 9-12:** Minimal returns (cleanup)
3. **1500-1700:** Circulation of 150 bbls hot oil (180°F) to lift debris
4. **1700-1800:** Well return to production
   - **1745:** Well flowing at 750 BOPD ✅
   - **Returns:** ZERO WAX ✅

## Wax Prevention Program (Implemented)

### Continuous Chemical Inhibitor System
**Installed:** February 5, 2024
- **Method:** Downhole injection via 1/4" capillary string
- **Chemical:** Crystal modifier (prevents wax nucleation)
- **Injection Rate:** 1 gallon per day
- **Annual Cost:** $120K
- **Result:** Zero wax deposition (9+ months) ✅

### Quarterly Hot Oil Treatments
- **Method:** Pump 50 bbls hot oil (200°F) through tubing
- **Frequency:** Every 3 months
- **Cost:** $15K per treatment
- **Purpose:** Preventive flush to remove trace wax

### Results (9 Months Post-Intervention)
- ✅ Zero wax-related production issues
- ✅ Stable 800 BOPD production  
- ✅ Prevention cost: $120K/year
- ✅ Avoided remediation cost: $650K/year
- ✅ **ROI on prevention: 5.4x**

## Key Learnings

✅ **Dual Approach Works:** Chemical softening + mechanical removal = complete clearance
✅ **Temperature Critical:** Hot chemicals (180°F+) above wax melting point essential
✅ **Prevention Better:** $120K/year prevention vs. $650K remediation
✅ **Early Detection:** Monitor production decline - intervene before 100% blockage

**Key Insight:** For waxy crude producers, continuous chemical inhibition is FAR more cost-effective than periodic remediation.
