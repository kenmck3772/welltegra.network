## 10. Key Learnings & Case Study Value

### Casing Integrity Challenge
This well experienced severe casing ovalization at 8,500 ft due to reservoir depletion and geomechanical stress. The reduced internal diameter (7.1") prevented passage of standard 2.313" OD intervention tools, significantly limiting production optimization capabilities.

### Remediation Success
The successful installation of a 60-ft expandable steel patch (Enventure ESeal) restored the casing ID to 8.5", enabling:
- ✅ Full-bore tool access for future interventions
- ✅ Restoration of production to design capacity
- ✅ Extended well life by 10+ years
- ✅ Avoided cost of sidetrack or abandonment (~$15-25M savings)

### Value to Well-Tegra Platform
**"The Brahan Squeeze"** demonstrates:
1. **Early Detection:** Multi-finger caliper (MFC) logs identified the problem before catastrophic failure
2. **Remediation Planning:** AI-assisted intervention planning optimized patch selection and installation procedures
3. **Cost Avoidance:** $500K remediation vs. $15-25M sidetrack/abandonment
4. **Production Recovery:** Well returned to 100% capacity within 2 weeks

**ROI:** 30-50x return on remediation investment
