## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Production casing (9.625" P110) at 8,500 ft MD experienced severe ovalization reducing the internal diameter from 8.681" to 7.1". This restriction prevented passage of standard 2.313" OD intervention tools, severely limiting production optimization capabilities.

### Root Cause
- **Primary Cause:** Reservoir depletion + geomechanical stress
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - 10+ years of continuous production
  - Reservoir pressure decline from 12,500 psi to 8,200 psi
  - Formation loading on casing string
  - Casing positioned at geological stress transition zone

### Solution Selected
**Enventure ESeal 60-ft Expandable Steel Patch**
- **Manufacturer:** Halliburton Enventure
- **Model:** ESeal 60ft x 9 5/8"
- **Serial Number:** ENV-PATCH-23-4421
- **Setting Depth:** 8,500 ft MD
- **Restored ID:** 8.5" (from 7.1")
- **Result:** Full-bore tool access restored

### Business Impact
- **Cost:** $500K (patch + installation)
- **Alternative Cost:** $15-25M (sidetrack or workover)
- **Cost Savings:** $14.5-24.5M
- **ROI:** 29-49x
- **Production Impact:** Full capacity restored
- **Well Life Extension:** 10+ years

## Pre-Intervention Assessment

### Initial Detection
- **Date:** November 10, 2023
- **Method:** Routine wireline operations - tool stuck at 8,500 ft
- **Confirmation:** Multi-finger caliper (MFC) log on November 12, 2023

### MFC Log Results
```
Depth: 8,500 ft MD
Original Casing ID: 8.681"
Measured Minimum ID: 7.1" (18% reduction)
Measured Maximum ID: 8.4"
Ovalization Type: Severe (non-uniform)
Length of Deformation: ~120 ft (8,440 - 8,560 ft)
Worst Section: 8,495 - 8,505 ft (7.1" ID)
```

### Restriction Analysis
- **2.313" OD tools:** Cannot pass through 7.1" restriction
- **Production Impact:** Unable to run production logging tools
- **Optimization Impact:** Cannot perform acid stimulation, scale treatments
- **Future Risk:** Restriction will worsen with continued depletion

### Engineering Options Evaluation

| Option | Cost | Duration | Risk | Outcome |
|--------|------|----------|------|---------|
| **Do Nothing** | $0 | - | HIGH | Continued production decline, eventual well shut-in |
| **Sidetrack** | $18-25M | 45+ days | MEDIUM | New wellbore, avoid deformed section |
| **Expandable Patch** | $500K | 2 days | LOW | Restore ID, maintain existing wellbore |
| **Full Workover** | $15-20M | 30+ days | MEDIUM | Replace tubing/casing (not feasible) |

**Selected Option:** Expandable Patch
- ✅ Lowest cost
- ✅ Fastest execution
- ✅ Proven technology (80%+ success rate)
- ✅ Minimal production downtime
- ✅ Future tool access restored
