## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Hard barium sulfate (BaSO₄) scale bridge completely blocked production at 9,200 ft MD. The 120-ft thick scale deposit (composition >97% BaSO₄) prevented all fluid flow, resulting in zero production from a well capable of 1,800 BOPD equivalent.

### Root Cause
- **Primary Cause:** Barium in formation water + sulfate in seawater injection
- **Chemical Reaction:** Ba²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄ ↓ (highly insoluble precipitate)
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - No scale inhibitor program in place
  - Pressure/temperature changes during production
  - 7 years of gradual scale accumulation
  - Seawater breakthrough from injection well

### Solution Selected
**Two-Phase Approach:**
1. **Phase 1:** 48-hour DTPA chemical soak to soften scale
2. **Phase 2:** High-pressure coiled tubing jetting to mechanically remove scale

### Business Impact
- **Cost:** $750K (chemicals + CT operation)
- **Alternative Cost:** $5-8M (workover to replace completion)
- **Cost Savings:** $4.25-7.25M
- **ROI:** 5.7-9.7x
- **Deferred Production:** $425K (15 days @ 1,800 BOPD equiv.)
- **Total Cost:** $1.175M
- **Well Life Extension:** 10+ years

- **Date:** January 5, 2024
- **Method:** Production decline from 1,800 to 0 BOPD over 3 days
- **Confirmation:** Wireline pressure gauge stuck at 9,200 ft

### Scale Analysis
**Sample Collection:** January 8, 2024
- **Method:** Wireline bailer sample from top of bridge
- **Lab Analysis Results:**
  ```
  Composition: BaSO₄ (97.3%), FeS (1.8%), Other (0.9%)
  Hardness: Severe (Mohs 3-3.5)
  Density: 4.5 g/cm³
  Solubility: Extremely low in water
  Color: White to gray
  ```

### Bridge Characterization
```
Top of Scale Bridge: 9,080 ft MD
Bottom of Bridge: 9,200 ft MD
Estimated Thickness: 120 ft
Estimated Volume: 28 barrels

```

### Chemical Treatment Options Evaluation

| Chemical | Solubility | Time | Cost | Success Rate |
|----------|------------|------|------|--------------|
| **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)** | Poor for BaSO₄ | Fast | Low | 10-20% |
| **EDTA** | Moderate | 24-48 hrs | Medium | 40-60% |
| **DTPA** | Good | 48-72 hrs | High | 70-85% |
| **Converter + HCl** | Good | 48 hrs | High | 60-75% |

**Selected: DTPA (Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid)**
- ✅ Best solubility for hard BaSO₄ scale
- ✅ Proven track record (70-85% success)
- ✅ Compatible with well metallurgy (L80-13Cr tubing)
- ✅ Environmentally acceptable

## Intervention Planning

### Phase 1: Chemical Treatment Design

#### DTPA Formulation
- **Base Chemical:** DTPA pentasodium salt
- **Concentration:** 15% active DTPA
- **pH:** 12.5 (alkaline for optimal performance)
- **Temperature:** Ambient (will be heated downhole by formation)
- **Volume:** 85 barrels
- **Contact Time:** 48 hours minimum

#### Chemical Mechanism
```
BaSO₄ (solid) + DTPA⁵⁻ → Ba-DTPA³⁻ (soluble) + SO₄²⁻

The DTPA chelates (binds) Ba²⁺ ions, pulling them out of the
crystal lattice and forming soluble Ba-DTPA complexes.
```

#### Placement Strategy
- **Delivery Method:** Coiled tubing displacement
- **Volume Above Bridge:** 45 barrels (9,080 - surface)
- **Volume in Bridge:** 30 barrels (contact with scale)
- **Volume Below Bridge:** 10 barrels (safety margin)
- **Total:** 85 barrels

### Phase 2: Mechanical Removal Design

#### High-Pressure Jetting Equipment
- **CT Size:** 2.375" OD coiled tubing
- **Jetting Tool:** Rotating jetting head (Baker Hughes)
- **Number of Nozzles:** 6 (forward-facing)
- **Nozzle Size:** 1/8" diameter
- **Jetting Pressure:** 7,500 psi
- **Flow Rate:** 6 barrels per minute
- **Jetting Fluid:** Hot completion brine (180°F)

#### Mechanical Strategy
1. **Initial Pass:** Break through center of bridge with jetting
2. **Subsequent Passes:** Widen hole and remove remaining scale
3. **Circulation:** Continuous circulation to lift cuttings
4. **Monitoring:** Real-time CT weight and pressure monitoring

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. **DTPA Chemical:** 48-hour soak effectively softened hard BaSO₄ scale
2. **High-Pressure Jetting:** Breakthrough on first pass after chemical treatment
3. **Hot Brine Circulation:** 180°F brine enhanced scale removal
4. **Sequential Approach:** Chemical first, mechanical second = success
5. **Production Recovery:** 99% capacity restored (1,750 BOPD)

### Challenges Encountered ⚠️
1. **Chemical Cost:** DTPA expensive ($320K) but necessary for BaSO₄
2. **Soak Time:** 48 hours required - no shortcuts possible
3. **Scale Hardness:** Even with chemical, required 6 jetting passes
4. **Circulation:** Large volume required (150 bbls) to clear all debris

### Recommendations for Future Jobs 📋
1. **Prevention First:** Implement scale inhibitor program from Day 1
2. **Early Detection:** Monitor for production decline (don't wait for 100% blockage)
3. **Chemical Soak:** Don't skip or shorten - 48 hours minimum for BaSO₄
4. **Jetting Equipment:** High-pressure capability essential (7,500+ psi)
5. **Hot Fluid:** Use hot brine (180°F+) for maximum effectiveness

### For Operations Teams
- **BaSO₄ Scale is Challenging:** Hardest scale type to remove (DTPA required)
- **Two-Phase Approach Works:** Chemical softening + mechanical removal = success
- **Prevention is Cheaper:** $180K/year prevention vs. $750K remediation
- **Early Action:** Don't wait for 100% blockage - intervene at first signs

### For Well Planners
- **Scale Inhibitor Programs:** Essential for wells with seawater injection
- **Monitoring:** Monthly production tracking detects problems early
- **Cost Model:** Include prevention costs in well economics
- **Intervention Planning:** Chemical + mechanical approach for hard scale

### For Well-Tegra Platform
**"The Scale Trap"** demonstrates that AI-assisted intervention planning can:
1. ✅ Select optimal chemical (DTPA vs. HCl vs. EDTA)
2. ✅ Determine soak time (48 hours for BaSO₄)
3. ✅ Plan mechanical approach (jetting parameters)
