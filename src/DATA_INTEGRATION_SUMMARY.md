## Case Study Highlights

### 🏆 Well 777 - "Field of Dreams"
**The Flagship Example**

**Challenge:** 3 simultaneous integrity issues (casing deformation, SSSV failure, sand production)

**Traditional Approach:** $35-55M subsea workover

**AI-Assisted Approach:** $7.85M sequential interventions
- Campaign 1: Casing patch (1 day, $600K)
- Campaign 2: Insert valve (3 days, $550K)
- Campaign 3: Sand screen (5 days, $900K)

**Result:** $27-47M saved through AI-assisted planning
**Current Status:** Peak performance (6,500 BOPD), zero issues after 12+ months

### 🎯 Key Differentiators

1. **Casing Integrity** (Wells 11, 777)
   - Expandable patches restore full-bore access
   - $500-600K vs. $15-25M sidetrack
   - 1-2 day execution vs. 30-45 days

2. **Scale Management** (Well 22)
   - DTPA chemical + mechanical removal
   - $750K vs. $5-8M workover
   - 48-hour chemical soak critical for BaSO₄

3. **Safety Barrier Remediation** (Wells 33, 777)
   - Insert valve technology
   - $450-550K vs. $6-8M workover
   - Wireline retrievable (future-proofed)

4. **Sand Control** (Wells 44, 777)
   - Through-tubing expandable screens
   - $850-900K vs. $8-12M workover
   - Zero sand production (12+ months verified)

5. **Wax Management** (Well 55)
   - Chemical + mechanical removal
   - $650K intervention vs. $5-7M workover
   - $120K/year prevention program (ROI: 5.4x)
