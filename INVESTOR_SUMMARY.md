# WELLTEGRA LTD - INVESTOR SUMMARY
**Sovereign Industrial AI Platform | R&D/Beta Phase**

---

## THE COMPANY

**WellTegra Ltd** (SC876023 | Incorporated January 21, 2026)

Sovereign Industrial AI platform (R&D/Beta) providing forensic ground truth for North Sea wellbore integrity using Physical AI (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections). Edge-first architecture with cloud GPU training, NSTA workflow-optimized.

**Founder:** Kenneth McKenzie, Chief AI Architect
**Heritage:** 30 years Engineer of Record across Perfect 11 North Sea assets (442 wells)

---

## THE PROBLEM: £2.1B AT RISK

The UK North Sea decommissioning crisis (5,600+ wells, £60B total cost 2026-2050):

1. **Data Decay**: 57 years of records across paper/microfiche/SQL (1967-2024)
2. **Datum Errors**: 80ft vertical shifts (KB→GL conversions) corrupt £2.1B in decommissioning bonds
3. **"Phantom Emissions"**: Depth errors → incorrect UK ETS carbon tax reporting
4. **HMRC Repudiation**: £1.58B EPL tax relief at stake without non-repudiable evidence
5. **NSTA Mandate**: WIOS (Jan 8, 2026) requires "AI-supported data discovery"

**Example:** Thistle A-12 wellbore
- Incorrect depth: 8,247 ft → Correct: 8,214 ft (-80ft datum error)
- Impact: £20M decommissioning bond value erosion per field

## THE SOLUTION: THE BRAHAN ENGINE

Sovereign Industrial AI platform with three pillars:

### 1. Manifold Reasoning (Physics-Invariant AI)

- **Research Benchmark:** 74% accuracy on citation networks (PubMed, arXiv:2601.02451)
- **Engineering Target:** North Sea wellbore correlation networks (442 wells)
- **arXiv citations**: 2512.24880, 2601.02451

### 2. Agentic Consensus (11-Agent Protocol)
- Multi-disciplinary validation (Drilling, HSE, Reservoir, Integrity, Regulatory, etc.)
- Runs on dedicated **multi-core ARM processors** for deterministic execution
- Minimum 9/11 threshold for forensic report approval

### 3. Digital Notary (Cryptographic Non-Repudiation)
- GPG RSA-4096 signing via **hardware-accelerated crypto processors**
- Hardware-based secure enclaves for key storage
- Satisfies NSTA workflow requirements, HMRC fiscal integrity

## BUSINESS MODEL

**Revenue:** £50,000 per well forensic audit (SaaS subscription)

**Example ROI for Customer (Thistle Field, 40 wells):**
- Liability Mitigation: £168M (depth error correction)
- Carbon Tax Savings: £1,632 ("Phantom Emissions" eliminated)
- EPL Tax Relief: £150M (HMRC fiscal integrity)
- **Total Value:** £318M
- **WellTegra Cost:** £2.0M
- **Customer ROI:** **159× ROI**

*Note: ROI based on industry-standard NPT risk models (£2.1M/well median). Actual results vary by asset. Thistle-specific validation pending.*
