## Feature 1: Real-Time Anomaly Detection

### Business Problem
- NPT (Non-Productive Time) costs operators $2M+ annually per well
- Most problems are detected after they've already caused damage
- Engineers monitor dozens of parameters manually
- Critical trends are missed in data overload

### Solution
An intelligent monitoring system that watches critical parameters in real-time and alerts operators to dangerous conditions before they become incidents.

### Technical Implementation

**Monitored Parameters**:
1. **Wellhead Pressure (WHP)**
   - Warning threshold: >6,500 psi
   - Critical threshold: >8,000 psi
   - Detection: Potential kick or well control issue

2. **Hookload (HL)**
   - High warning: >380 klbs
   - High critical: >450 klbs (stuck pipe)
   - Low warning: <150 klbs (free-falling pipe or equipment failure)

**Alert Levels**:
- **Warning (Yellow)**: Concerning trend, monitor closely
- **Critical (Red)**: Dangerous condition, immediate action required
- **Resolved (Green)**: Issue has been addressed

**Alert Components**:
- Real-time parameter values
- Threshold comparison
- Specific recommendations
- Timestamp for audit trail
- Visual indicators (icons, colors, animations)

### User Experience

**In Normal Conditions**:
- Display shows: "Monitoring for anomalies... All systems normal."
- Green indicator showing active monitoring

**When Anomaly Detected**:
1. Alert slides in from right with animation
2. Color-coded border (yellow or red)
3. Pulsing icon to draw attention
4. Clear description of the problem
5. Specific recommendation for action
6. Timestamp for logging

**Auto-Resolution**:
- Warnings auto-resolve after 5 minutes if conditions normalize
- Critical alerts require manual acknowledgment
- All alerts remain in audit trail

### Demo Talking Points

**Setup (10 seconds)**:
"As the well is being drilled, Well-Tegra monitors every parameter in real-time..."

**The Moment (15 seconds)**:
"Watch what happens at minute 75... [pause]... There! The system just detected a hookload spike indicating potential stuck pipe."

**The Value (15 seconds)**:
"Notice the specific recommendation: STOP PULLING, initiate stuck pipe procedures. This alert came 10 minutes before our engineer would have noticed the trend. That's the difference between a minor issue and a $500K NPT incident."

### Business Value

**Quantifiable Benefits**:
- Prevents 1-2 NPT incidents per well
- Average NPT cost: $200K-$500K per incident
- ROI: 10-25x platform cost

**Operational Benefits**:
- Reduces cognitive load on engineers

## Demo Script

### The Complete 5-Minute Demo

**Opening (30 seconds)**
"Thank you for your time. In the next 5 minutes, I'm going to show you how Well-Tegra prevents the NPT incidents that cost you millions while saving your engineers days of manual work. This isn't theoryâ€”let me show you."

**Phase 1: Planning (1 minute)**
"We start with well planning. [Click Planner view] Well-Tegra analyzes your historical data, identifies risks, and generates a comprehensive intervention plan. Look at thisâ€”it flagged stuck pipe risk at 12,500 feet based on similar wells. That's intelligence, not just data storage."

**Phase 2: Live Operations - THE WOW MOMENT (2 minutes)**
"Now we move to live operations. [Click Performer view] You're watching real-time data from the rig. Hookload, wellhead pressure, depthâ€”all monitored continuously.

Watch what happens at about minute 75... [pause for effect]... There! [Point to anomaly alert] The system just detected a critical hookload spike. This is stuck pipe starting to happen.

Look at the recommendation: 'STOP PULLING. Initiate stuck pipe procedures.' This alert came 10-15 minutes before your engineer would have spotted the trend manually. That's the difference between a $5,000 problem and a $500,000 NPT incident.

This has happened to every one of you. The driller keeps pulling, the engineer doesn't notice until it's too late, and you're stuck for 3 days. Well-Tegra catches it in real-time."

**Phase 3: Analysis (1 minute)**
"After operations, the Analysis view shows you everything. [Click Analyzer view]

KPIs: Cost savings, time saved, NPT avoidedâ€”all calculated automatically.

And here's something your competitors aren't doing: [Point to Vendor Scorecard] A complete vendor performance scorecard. Six key metrics, star ratings, overall score. When you negotiate your next contract, you have data, not gut feelings. 'Your on-time delivery is excellent at 95%, but your cost competitiveness is 78%. Let's discuss pricing.' That's negotiating power."

**Phase 4: The Final WOW (30 seconds)**
"And here's the cherry on top. [Click PDF Export button] Watch this... [Wait for PDF to download]

[Open PDF] A complete close-out report. Executive summary, all KPIs, vendor performance, everything. Professional formatting, ready to send to your stakeholders.

How long does this take your team? 2 days? 3 days? Well-Tegra just did it in 3 seconds."

**Closing (30 seconds)**
"So let's recap: Well-Tegra prevented a $500K NPT incident, provided data-driven vendor insights worth $100K in negotiations, and saved your engineer 3 days of report writing. The platform costs a fraction of a single prevented incident.

The question isn't whether you can afford Well-Tegra. It's whether you can afford not to have it.

What questions can I answer?"

### Demo Tips

**Energy**:
- Speak with confidence and pace
- Build anticipation before the anomaly alert
- Use pauses for emphasis
- Show genuine enthusiasm for the PDF generation

**Interactivity**:
- Ask: "Has this happened to you?" after stuck pipe story
- Get nods of recognition
- Connect features to their pain points

**Customization**:
- If audience is operations-focused: Emphasize anomaly detection and NPT prevention
