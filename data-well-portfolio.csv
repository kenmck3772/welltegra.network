W666,The Perfect Storm,Montrose,UKCS,HPHT Gas Condensate,18500,"Shut-in - Well Integrity Issues","Compound casing, scale, and safety barrier failures demand an integrated intervention sequence before operations can resume.","Pairing expandable patches, chemical/jetting scale removal, and safety valve remediation is required to recover integrity."
M-21,CASE STUDY: The Montrose Squeeze,Montrose,UKCS,HPHT Gas Condensate,9000,"Active - Restored Production","SOLUTION: Casing deformation was successfully remediated with an expandable patch.","Expandable steel patches provide a rigless pathway to restore full-bore access across deformed intervals."
S-15,CASE STUDY: The Scale Trap,Montrose,UKCS,HPHT Gas Condensate,11000,"Active - Restored Production","SOLUTION: Severe BaSO4 scale was successfully removed with a chemical/jetting treatment.","Combining DTPA dissolver soaks with rotating jetting heads clears hardened scale without stuck-pipe risk."
F-11,CASE STUDY: The Broken Barrier,Montrose,UKCS,HPHT Gas Condensate,9800,"Active - Restored Production","SOLUTION: Failed TRSSV was locked open and replaced with a slickline-retrievable insert valve.","Mechanical lock-open tools followed by insert valves restore primary safety barriers quickly and cost-effectively."
C-08,CASE STUDY: The Sandstorm,Montrose,UKCS,HPHT Gas Condensate,10000,"Active - Restored Production","SOLUTION: Failed sand screen was repaired with a through-tubing patch.","Through-tubing expandable patches eliminate sustained sand ingress without a full workover."
P-12,CASE STUDY: The Wax Plug,Piper,UKCS,Oil Producer,7500,"Active - Restored Production","SOLUTION: Severe paraffin wax blockage was cleared using CT with a chemical/mechanical approach.","Heated chemical dissolvers combined with mechanical scrapers on CT deliver durable wax remediation."
S-77,CASE STUDY: Field of Dreams,Schiehallion,UKCS,HPHT Oil Producer,19200,"Active - Peak Performance","SOLUTION: Multi-barrier failure resolution delivering blueprint results across the portfolio.","Integrated, multi-discipline intervention campaigns compress timelines and maximise production uplift."
