## 🎨 Screenshot Best Practices

- **File Size:** Compress if > 500 KB (use [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com/))

### Composition
- **Avoid clutter:** Close unnecessary browser tabs
- **Hide bookmarks bar:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Chrome)
- **Full page:** Capture entire page, not just viewport
- **Highlight interactions:** Show expanded/hover states

### Annotation (Optional)
- Add arrows pointing to key features
- Highlight interactive elements (buttons, filters)
- Add captions for complex features

## 📝 Adding Screenshots to README

After capturing, update `README.md`:

**1. Replace placeholder in Featured section:**
```markdown
### Screenshot
![Forensic Team Grid](assets/images/screenshots/forensic-team-grid-desktop.png)
*11-person forensic engineering team with interactive filtering and smooth animations*
```

**2. Add to Screenshots section:**
```markdown
### Forensic Engineering Team Grid

**Desktop View:**
