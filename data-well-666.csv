General,,Name,The Perfect Storm
General,,Field,Montrose
General,,Region,UKCS
General,,Type,HPHT Gas Condensate
General,,Measured Depth,"18,500 ft"
General,,Status,"Shut-in - Well Integrity Issues"
General,,Primary Issue,"A nightmare well with multiple, compounding failures: severe casing deformation, a hard scale blockage, and a failed primary safety valve. Requires a complex, multi-stage intervention plan."
History,2024-03-15,Operation,Slickline Surveillance
History,2024-03-15,Problem,"Unable to pass 8,500ft due to casing restriction."
History,2024-03-15,Lesson,"This well combines multiple known failure modes from this field into a single asset."
History,2024-04-01,Operation,Production Test
History,2024-04-01,Problem,"Well died after brief flow period. Pressure analysis suggests deep blockage."
History,2024-04-01,Lesson,"Suspect combination of scale and integrity issues."
History,2024-04-10,Operation,DHSV Test
History,2024-04-10,Problem,"TRSSV failed to close on command. Well shut-in on annulus valves."
History,2024-04-10,Lesson,"Well integrity is critically compromised."
