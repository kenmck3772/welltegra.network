## 🎬 Act 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)

### Opening Line

> **"Let me show you how Well-Tegra prevents the NPT incidents that cost you millions."**

### Talking Points (While Loading Homepage)

**If prospect is from Operations:**
> "Every well engineer has horror stories about NPT. Stuck pipe, wellbore instability, kicks... they all add up to millions in lost time and equipment. The problem isn't that we don't have data—it's that we catch problems too late."

**If prospect is from Finance/Management:**
> "NPT costs the industry $2 million per well annually. Most of that is preventable if we catch problems early. Well-Tegra pays for itself with just one prevented incident."

**If prospect is Technical (Well Engineer/Supervisor):**
> "You're monitoring 20+ parameters in real-time, juggling spreadsheets, calling vendors, writing reports. Well-Tegra does the pattern recognition for you and tells you what to do before things go wrong."

### Screen Position

**Homepage visible with:**
- Hero section showing: "AI-Powered Well Intervention Planning"
- Well 666 card visible in dashboard
- Clean, professional interface

### Transition

> "Today I'm going to walk you through a real scenario we call 'The Perfect Storm' - a complex HPHT well that should have been a disaster but wasn't, because the system caught the problem at minute 75."

**⏱️ Elapsed Time: 0:30**

---

## 🎬 Act 2: Planning Phase (0:30 - 1:30)

### Action: Navigate to Planner

**Click:** "Try the Planner" button or Well 666 card

### Narration

> "This is Well 666 in the Brahan Field - a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate well. It's producing, but production is declining due to barium sulfate scale buildup. We need to intervene."

### Screen: Well Selection & Problem Identification

**Highlight on screen:**
- Well 666 details (depth: 3,500m, pressure: 10,000 psi, temp: 150°C)
- Current problem: Scale accumulation
- Intervention objective: Restore production

### Action: Select Intervention Type

**Click:** "Generate AI Plan" or similar button

### Narration (While AI Generates Plan)

> "Well-Tegra's AI analyzes 1,200+ historical interventions in similar wells. It's cross-referencing your well conditions, historical success rates, equipment availability, and cost-effectiveness. This takes about 5 seconds—normally this would take a senior engineer 2-3 days."

### Screen: Generated Plan Appears

**Scroll through plan briefly, highlighting:**
- ✅ Procedure steps (30+ operations)
- ✅ Tool string recommendation (coiled tubing, jetting tools)
- ✅ Chemical treatment (15% HCl + inhibitors)
- ✅ Risk assessment (wellbore stability: MEDIUM)
- ✅ Cost estimate ($450K)
- ✅ Time estimate (72 hours)

### Key Quote

> "The platform just generated a complete intervention plan with procedures, equipment, chemicals, risks, and costs. In 5 seconds."

**⏱️ Elapsed Time: 1:30**

---

## 🎬 Act 3: Live Operations - THE KEY MOMENT (1:30 - 3:30)

### Action: Switch to Performer View

**Click:** "Performer" tab or "Live Operations" button

### Narration

> "Now let's jump forward. The plan is approved, the crew is on location, and operations are underway. This is the 'Performer' view—your real-time operations dashboard."

### Screen: Live Operations Dashboard

**Point out key gauges:**
- Hookload gauge (green, ~220 klbs)
- Wellhead Pressure (green, ~4,500 psi)
- Depth tracker (real-time)
- Operation log (scrolling activity)

### Narration

> "We're monitoring hookload, wellhead pressure, depth, rate of penetration, and 15+ other parameters. Everything looks good... operations proceeding normally..."

### ⚡ THE KEY MOMENT: Anomaly Detection (Minute 2:00)

**Action:** Trigger demo anomaly OR show recorded example

### Screen: Yellow Warning Appears

**Alert shown:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Hookload Trending High
Current: 385 klbs | Threshold: 380 klbs
Recommendation: Reduce WOB, monitor closely
```

### Narration (Excited tone)

> "Wait—see that? At minute 75, the system detected hookload trending above normal. This is subtle—most engineers wouldn't catch this for another 10-15 minutes. But Well-Tegra's AI caught it immediately."

### Action: Click on Alert for Details

### Screen: Alert Details Modal

**Show:**
- Hookload trend chart (gradual increase)
- Possible causes: Differential sticking, cuttings accumulation
- Recommended actions: Reduce WOB, increase circulation rate, prepare spotting fluid
- Estimated cost if ignored: $500K NPT (stuck pipe scenario)

### Narration (Serious tone)

> "Here's what makes this critical: if we ignore this for 30 more minutes, we're looking at stuck pipe—a $500,000 NPT event minimum. Pipe stuck, fishing operations, possible sidetrack. But because we caught it early, the driller can take corrective action *right now*."

### Action: Show "Initiate MOC" (Management of Change) button

### Narration

> "The system automatically generates a Management of Change recommendation. One click sends this to the toolpusher and operations engineer. They adjust drilling parameters, circulation is increased, and... crisis averted."

### Screen: Alert Resolves (Green)

**Show:**
```
✅ RESOLVED: Hookload normalized
Duration: 12 minutes | Action: Reduced WOB, increased circulation
NPT Avoided: $500K | Time Saved: 3.5 days
```

### Key Quote

> "That's the difference. Traditional monitoring: you catch this 30 minutes later when pipe is already stuck. Well-Tegra: you prevent it from happening. That one alert just paid for the platform for a year."

**⏱️ Elapsed Time: 3:30**

---

## 🎬 Act 4: Analysis Phase (3:30 - 4:30)

### Action: Switch to Analyzer View

**Click:** "Analyzer" tab

### Narration

## 🎯 Objection Handling

### Objection: "We already have monitoring software"

**Response:**
> "Great! What you have monitors parameters. Well-Tegra goes a step further—it interprets those parameters and tells you what action to take. It's the difference between a car dashboard and a self-driving car. You still make the decisions, but Well-Tegra does the analysis."

### Objection: "This looks expensive"

**Response:**
> "Let me put it in perspective: our Enterprise tier is $150K-$300K annually. One prevented NPT incident—just one—saves you $500K minimum. Your ROI is often within the first 30 days. Would you like me to run your specific numbers?"

### Objection: "Our engineers are too busy to learn new software"

**Response:**
> "I hear that a lot. Here's the thing: Well-Tegra *reduces* workload. Your engineers spend less time in spreadsheets and more time making decisions. We typically see 30-40% reduction in planning time and 80% reduction in reporting time. It's not more work—it's less."

### Objection: "We need to see it work with our data first"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely. That's exactly what I'm proposing. Send me a well file—doesn't have to be perfect, just representative. I'll import it, show you Well-Tegra working with your data, and you can evaluate from there. Sound fair?"

### Objection: "We need internal approval / budget"

**Response:**
> "Understood. What would help you make the internal case? I can provide an ROI analysis, references from similar operators, or join a call with your leadership team. What's the approval process look like?"

## 🚀 Advanced Demo Techniques

### Interactive Q&A During Demo

**Good questions to ask mid-demo:**

1. (After Plan Generation) "What does your current planning process look like?"
2. (After Anomaly Alert) "Have you experienced stuck pipe in the last 12 months?"
3. (After Vendor Scorecard) "How do you currently evaluate vendor performance?"
4. (After PDF Export) "Who typically writes your close-out reports?"

### Handling Technical Issues

**If website is slow:**
> "Looks like we've got some latency—must be everyone wanting a demo! Let me jump to the next section..."

**If feature doesn't work:**
> "I'm going to show you a recording of this feature because the live environment is being temperamental. Here's what it looks like..."

**If prospect loses connection (Zoom/Teams):**
> Text/email immediately: "Lost connection. Rejoining in 2 minutes." Don't leave them hanging.

### Multi-Well Demos (For Enterprise Prospects)

If prospect manages 50+ wells, show:
- Dashboard view with multiple wells
- Portfolio-wide risk analysis
- Cross-well cost comparison
- Consolidated vendor performance across all operations
