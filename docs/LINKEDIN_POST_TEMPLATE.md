## 🚀 Post #1: The Main Announcement

### Headline
**I just deployed a "Physics-Informed" AI to the Cloud. (Here's the code).**

### Body

```
After 30 years, I stood on rig floors making split-second decisions based on gauges and gut instinct.

Today, I deployed the tool I wish I had back then.

🚀 Meet the Brahan Vertex Engine (v2.0)

It's not just a dashboard. It's a Closed-Loop Decision System hosted on Google Cloud.

THE PROBLEM:
Pure Machine Learning models can hallucinate. They miss "Black Swan" events they haven't seen in training data.

THE SOLUTION:
I built a "Physics-Informed Toggle" into the React frontend.

🔧 How it works:

1. Standard ML: Predicts anomalies based on data patterns.

2. Physics Mode: Overrides the ML if thermodynamic laws are violated (e.g., Burst Pressure limits).

3. The Kicker: If an operator tries to bypass a safety protocol, the system LOCKS THE CONTROLS and auto-redirects them to a remedial training module.

This is the difference between "Data Science" and "Industrial Engineering."

THE STACK:
• Frontend: React + Three.js (3D Visualization)
• Backend: Python (FastAPI) + Google Vertex AI
• DevOps: GitHub Actions → Cloud Run

## 📊 Post #2: The Technical Deep Dive (Post 2-3 days later)

### Headline
**How I Built a "Closed-Loop Training System" That Forces Competency**

### Body

```
Most AI dashboards just show pretty graphs.

Mine locks you out until you prove you understand what went wrong.

Here's the logic I built into the Brahan Vertex Engine:

⚠️ THE SCENARIO:

Operator toggles "Physics Mode" ON → System detects rapid pressure decline → Node-02 drops from 12% integrity to CRITICAL (0%).

Operator tries to click "Confirm Operational Phase."

🚫 WHAT HAPPENS:

1. Execution button DISABLED instantly
2. Auto-redirect to "Competency Training"
3. Banner appears: "System Trigger: Procedural Violation Detected"
4. Quiz assigned: 3 questions on physics constraints, rapid bleed down, closed-loop learning
5. Must score ≥80% to unlock controls
6. Event logged for compliance audit trail

📝 THE CODE:

```javascript
const handleExecutionAttempt = () => {
  const bravoWell = wells.find(w => w.id === 'well-bravo');

  if (physicsMode && bravoWell && bravoWell.safetyLocked) {
    setTrainingReason('Procedural Violation Detected...');
    setActiveTab('competency');
    setShowTraining(true);
    return false; // Block execution
  }

  return true;
};
```

🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS:

The #1 cause of NPT (Non-Productive Time) isn't equipment failure.

It's operational drift.

This system doesn't just detect violations. It FIXES the operator.

That's the difference between a "dashboard" and a "decision system."

## 🏆 Post #3: The Differentiation Post (Post 1 week later)

### Headline
**Why I'm NOT a "Data Scientist" (And Why That Makes Me Valuable)**

### Body

```
Most ML engineers can build models.

I can build SYSTEMS.

Here's what I mean:

📊 DATA SCIENTISTS BUILD:
• Jupyter notebooks with 90% accuracy
• Training pipelines that run on clean data
• Models that need a data engineer to deploy

🏗️ I BUILD:
• Full-stack applications (React + Python + GCP)
• Event-driven architectures (Pub/Sub → Vertex AI → Firestore)
• CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions → Cloud Run)
• Physics-informed hybrid models that fail-safe
• 3D interactive visualizations (Three.js/WebGL)

THE DIFFERENCE:

I don't stop at the model. I ship the product.

EXAMPLE:
The Brahan Vertex Engine I just deployed has:

✅ 240ms inference latency (P50)
✅ 99.9% uptime (Cloud Run auto-scaling)
✅ Real-time 3D visualization
✅ Closed-loop training system
✅ Physics constraint validation
✅ Production CI/CD pipeline

It's not a portfolio project. It's a production-grade system.

And it's built by someone who spent 30 years on rig floors understanding the domain.

That's the value I bring.

## 💬 Response Templates for Common Comments

### Comment: "This is impressive! How long did it take to build?"

**Response:**
```
Thanks! The core React app took about 2 weeks of focused development. But the real learning was in the 30 years of well engineering that informed the physics constraints 😊

The hardest part wasn't the code - it was translating domain knowledge (rapid bleed down detection, barrier diagnostics) into deterministic rules that could override the ML model.

Happy to chat more about the architecture if you're interested!
```

### Comment: "Are you looking for opportunities?"

**Response:**
```
Yes! I'm actively seeking Cloud ML Engineer roles where deep industrial domain knowledge creates competitive advantage.

Ideally roles that involve:
• Physics-informed ML (not just pure data science)
• Industrial/energy applications
• GCP stack (Vertex AI, Cloud Run, BigQuery)
• Full-stack ownership (model → deployment)

Would love to connect and explore possibilities! 📧 kenmckenzie@welltegra.network
