## 📝 ABOUT SECTION (2,600 character limit)

```
30 Years of Grit. 5 Years of Code. One Mission.

I didn't build WellTegra to learn to code—I built it because I was tired of seeing $1.2M risks managed with gut feel.

═══════════════════════════════════════════

THE THREE-ACT TRANSFORMATION

→ Act I (1990-2020): Offshore Well Engineering
30 years across North Sea, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, West Africa. From telex machines to rig floor computers. Witnessed the first digital transformation.

→ Act II (2023): Blockchain Pioneer
Operated an Evernode Genesis Node on the XRP Ledger. Learned distributed systems, Linux infrastructure, DevOps—proving comfort with bleeding-edge technology.

→ Act III (2024-Now): Cloud ML Engineer
Built production AI systems on GCP. React + Python + Vertex AI + Cloud Functions. Physics-informed ML combining probabilistic models with deterministic safety rules.

This isn't a career change—it's a career evolution.

═══════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT I BUILD

🔹 Full-Stack ML Applications
   • Frontend: React, TypeScript, Three.js (WebGL 3D visualization)
   • Backend: Python, Flask, FastAPI
   • Cloud: GCP (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run)

🔹 Google AI Studio Early Adopter
   • 3 deployed applications integrating Google Gemini AI
   • Industrial engineering workflows with conversational AI
   • Toolstring configuration, 3D wellbore visualization, operational planning

🔹 Production Architecture
   • Serverless cloud functions with BigQuery integration
   • Event-driven pipelines (Pub/Sub, Dataflow)
   • Docker containerization, GitHub Actions CI/CD
   • Deployed to Cloud Run with auto-scaling

═══════════════════════════════════════════

WHY THIS MATTERS

Most ML engineers learn the tools, then look for a problem.

I spent 30 years with the problem, then learned the tools.

The difference: I can answer "Why does this prediction matter?" and "What happens if the model is wrong?" at depths that come only from field experience.

When physics says the model missed something critical, I know which one to trust.

═══════════════════════════════════════════

CURRENT FOCUS

Building physics-informed ML systems that combine:
• Domain expertise (well integrity, P&A operations, toolstring design)
• Cloud-native architecture (GCP, serverless, auto-scaling)
• Interactive UX (voice commands, 3D visualization, real-time dashboards)
• Closed-loop learning (automatic training redirect when safety violations detected)

Portfolio: welltegra.network
GitHub: github.com/kenmck3772

Open to Cloud ML Engineer roles where 30 years of offshore decision-making under uncertainty becomes a feature, not a footnote.

Let's connect.
