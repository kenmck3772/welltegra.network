## 📝 ABOUT SECTION (Copy & Paste Entire Block)

```markdown
I am an Engineer who speaks both "Driller" and "Python."

After 30+ years leading offshore well interventions across the North Sea, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, I experienced the same problem repeatedly: critical operational decisions made on fragmented Excel sheets and static PDFs.

In 2020, I made a hard pivot. I didn't just "learn to code"—I re-engineered the entire intervention workflow using Cloud-Native Architecture and Physics-Informed Machine Learning.

🎯 MY FOCUS: Industrial AI for Heavy Industry

I build systems that respect physical constraints (pressure gradients, material fatigue, thermodynamics) while leveraging modern ML for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.

📦 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS (Live at welltegra.network):

🔧 The Brahan Vertex Engine
• Physics-informed ML that overrides pure data-driven models when constraints are violated
• React + React Three Fiber for 3D wellbore visualization
• Closed-loop competency training triggered by safety anomalies
• Tech: Python (FastAPI), React, Google Cloud Run, Vertex AI

👁️ Vertex Vision (Computer Vision Safety System)
• Real-time rig floor monitoring with YOLOv8 object detection
• Validates torque settings and detects "red zone" personnel incursions
• Reduces NPT risk by flagging procedural violations in <500ms
• Tech: Google Vertex AI, TensorFlow, RTSP stream processing

📊 11 Pillars Data Architecture
• Framework for consolidating siloed well data (WITSML, PRODML, deviation surveys)
• Transforms "data chaos" into decision-ready insights
• Demonstrates Big Data engineering skills with domain expertise

🎓 Adaptive Competency Loops
• Automatic training assignment when digital twins detect safety violations

• CI/CD via GitHub Actions → Cloud Build
• BigQuery datasets for analytics
• Global Load Balancer with managed SSL
• Terraform for infrastructure as code

💡 WHAT I BRING:
I don't just write code—I build Operational Defensibility.

A "90% accuracy" model isn't acceptable when a blowout preventer is involved. I design AI guardrails that keep operations safe, compliant, and cost-effective.

Domain expertise + modern ML = Production-ready systems that actually get used.

📈 RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS:
• Google Developer Program Premium Tier (13 badges)
• Deployed 9 production Cloud Run services
• 1,357 lines of React code in single application (Brahan Vertex Engine)
• Built physics-informed ML system overriding pure data-driven models

I'm actively seeking Cloud ML Engineer roles where deep industrial domain knowledge creates competitive advantage.

## 📣 FIRST LINKEDIN POST (Announcement)

**Copy This and Post AFTER Profile Update:**

```markdown
After 30 years in offshore well engineering, I made a hard pivot.

I didn't just "learn to code." I re-engineered the entire intervention workflow using Cloud-Native Architecture and Physics-Informed Machine Learning.

🚀 What I've built (all live at welltegra.network):

✅ Brahan Vertex Engine: React app with Three.js 3D visualization demonstrating closed-loop competency training
✅ 9 Cloud Run microservices deployed on GCP
✅ Physics-informed ML pipeline on Vertex AI
✅ Computer vision safety system with <500ms inference latency

I'm not a developer who read about oil & gas.
I'm a well engineer who shipped production code.

I'm now seeking opportunities as a Cloud ML Engineer where my domain expertise in heavy industry can solve real operational problems.

If your team needs someone who understands both "Python and Drilling Mud," let's connect.

## 📊 SECOND POST (Week 2 - Technical Deep Dive)

```markdown
Most Machine Learning fails in industrial environments.

Here's why:

Pure data-driven models don't respect physics.

Example from my portfolio:
• Standard ML model: "12% integrity score - ACCEPTABLE"
• Physics-informed model: "Pressure drop violates thermodynamics - CRITICAL"

The ML model only looks at the data curve.
The physics engine knows that a 200 psi drop in 3 minutes = barrier failure.

This is the difference between "90% accuracy" and "Production Ready."

In heavy industry, you can't A/B test a blowout preventer.

I build AI systems with physical constraints built-in.

Domain expertise + Modern ML = Systems that actually get deployed.
